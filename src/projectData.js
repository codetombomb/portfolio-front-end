      "description": "Covid Chaos was my Mod 3 project at Flatiron School. It was the end of February 2020 when Flatiron School and many other schools sent thier students to work from home and self isolate. Toilet paper, and other essential items like hand sanitizer, became scarce as well as decency during the uncertain times. I knew I wanted to create a game for the project and thought that it would be a good distraction, to the madness unfolding around me, to tie the theme of the game to the chaos.",
